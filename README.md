# RESnet-m-py

3D resistor network solution for d.c. problems. Python implementation.

This is a python implementation of the Matlab code to solve for the electric field in underground space under the excitation of a DC power source.

#### Note：

This code solves large sparse matrices by calling the PyPardiso interface, and the sample code can be found in PyPardisoExample.py. Thanks to Wang Ke, the author of PyPardiso.py, for his technical guidance.
